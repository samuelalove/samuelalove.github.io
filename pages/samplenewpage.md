# Want to add a new page that doesn't exist?

1. Update the name of the markdown file in the field that reads `samplenewpage` above the Edit/Preview tabs (after `/demo/pages/` and before `in main`)
1. Change the value in the line that begins with `title` in the YML front-matter (the stuff between the `---` lines).
1. Keep the `layout: page` line. This adds your web site's navigation, header and footer.
1. Set the permalink value to the web site address you want people to go to. For instance, if your site URL is `digitalarcplatform.github.io` and you want people to see this page at `digitalarcplatform.github.io/about`, change that line to read `permalink: /about`
1. Replace the text here, starting with the large header (the line that starts with `#`) and including this text.
